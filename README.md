# VeryStrongPW
Intro to JS Challenge #3

This site generates a password of desired length and content depending on the prompts selected when the page loads. The prompts ask for password length and if special, lower, upper characters, or numbers should be included. When clicking the "Generate Password" button, the password following the defined prompts will be generated into the text field. 

Extra checks were placed in the prompts to ensure a number is entered for password length and that at least one character type is selected. If one of these situations occurs, it will alert the user to try again. An example of this show in Screenshot 1.
